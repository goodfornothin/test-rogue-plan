# Rogue Resonance – Participant Handout

*A one-page takeaway from Oscar Castellino's Bachata Workshop*

---

## The Core Idea

**Rogue Bachata** isn't about learning sequences—it's about developing sensitivity to yourself, your partner, the music, and the space. When these connections are strong, movement emerges naturally.

---

## The Four Connections

| Connect to... | How |
|---------------|-----|
| **Yourself** | Notice breath, weight, tension, mood. Observe without fixing. |
| **Your Partner** | Tune into their breathing and balance. Forget yourself briefly. |
| **The Room** | Feel the floor, temperature, acoustics, lighting. |
| **The Music** | Dance *this* song, not generic bachata. |

## Rogue Principles

### 1. Bounce and Roll (Brush Rarely)
- **Bounce** = elastic rebound when bodies meet
- **Roll** = contact travels smoothly (like in a turn)
- **Brush** = friction, unclear—avoid it

### 2. Stop and Connect
- At any moment, pause and check:
  - Am I balanced?
  - Is my partner balanced?
  - Are we truly connected?
- The pause gives you information.

### 3. Groundedness (from Salsa)
- Commit your weight fully to each step
- Lead from the core, not the arms

### 4. Flow (from Zouk)
- Let movement wave through the spine
- Head and pelvis connected, not isolated

### 5. Connection (inspired by Kizomba)
- Be aware of your partner's breathing rhythm
- Let intention travel from the chest, not just the arms
- Pauses become musical, not awkward

### 6. No Judgement, Only Support
- Different experiences make dancing interesting
- Compassion for yourself and partners

## The Rogue Mantra

> *"Connection, compassion, conviction, connection."*

---

## Take It to the Social Floor

- **Before dancing:** Breathe. Arrive in your body.
- **First few seconds:** Feel your partner's energy before moving.
- **During:** Bounce on direction changes. Roll on turns. Stop when you want to check in.
- **After:** Thank your partner genuinely—they gave you their trust.
