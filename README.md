## Core Principles

1. **Bounce and Roll** – Clear, intentional contact (not friction/brushing)
2. **Stop and Connect** – Pause to verify balance and connection
3. **Groundedness** – Full weight commitment (inspired by salsa)
4. **Flow** – Spinal waves and continuity (inspired by zouk)
5. **Connection** – Awareness of partner's breath and intention (inspired by kizomba – spoken concept only)
6. **No Judgement, Only Support** – Welcoming container for all experience levels
