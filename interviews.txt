Hi Oscar, 


Your full name and date of birth please, as well as name/age of siblings and parents. Where do your parents live now?


My full name is Oscar Castellino. I was born on 8th May 1986, and I am 39 years old. I have three siblings: my eldest brother Osmund Castellino, who is 47 years of age; my second brother Sam Castellino, who is 46; and my sister Sonia Castellino, who is 45 years of age. My two brothers studied at Sacred Heart School, Santa Cruz West
Dad : Edmund Castellino from Assagaon/Ajmer/Santacruz 3 Dec 1940 - 26 April 2011
Mom Osmita Castellino , Loutolim-Curtorim/Mazagaon 14 Sept 1949. Now lives in Santacruz West.
My father passed away in 2011, just before I left for London. His passing came right after I received my admission to the Royal College of Music. He was very keen on my opera singing and would play Pavarotti’s sacred recordings like Panis Angelicus (Pavarotti with his father), hoping one day we could sing it together. It meant everything to me that he knew I was moving to London to study music before his death. My mother now lives in Santa Cruz West, Mumbai, on Juhu Road.
1) Explain the Santa Cruz connection please. Besides the biographical details, you indicated that Santa Cruz was important in your development as a musician and artist. Please explain. 
My father moved to Santa Cruz from Ajmer, where he was born and grew up, to join the State Bank of India in 1969. Since then, both my paternal and maternal grandparents lived in Santa Cruz West on Juhu Road. We were part of the Sacred Heart Parish. I was born in 1986 in a car on the way to the hospital, in Santa Cruz West itself on Swami Vivekananda Road.
The Santa Cruz music scene is very vibrant. When attending church, I would hear wonderful singers. One I remember in particular was Gus D’Lima, who had a fabulous tenor voice, and I remember hearing him as a child. That made a lasting impact on me. Santa Cruz can boast of Patricia Rozario, who later went on to mentor me into the operatic world. My family always looked up to her and her achievements. When I finally met her, she heard my voice and encouraged me to move to London to train in opera. It was a great honor and a great moment for me.
I also sang in the Sacred Heart Choir with Father Aniceto Nazareth, and he would compose hymns. That showed me that somebody from India can compose hymns that are sung the world around. I also sang with Mimosa Almeida Pinto for the Christmas masses in Santa Cruz Parish, where we would have a large number of people attending on the grounds. It was wonderful to sing there to large congregations.. I also sang in the Prodigal Son musical at Santa Cruz Parish just before leaving for London to sing opera.
I also used to work in Santa Cruz East as a software engineer, so I have a very strong connection with Santa Cruz. There are many families in Santa Cruz West who boast great musical talent, so every mass had different singers of great capability, and that was wonderful to listen to.
Although I studied in Mussoorie at St. George's College—a wonderful school where I spent nine months—we would come for holidays to Mumbai and Goa, and I got to spend a lot of time in Santa Cruz. As a child I attended Santa Cruz Willingdon gymkhana which exposed me to very good talent.
Later I would join the Stop Gaps Choral Ensemble under Alfred D’Souza in Bandra which enhanced my performance skills and stagecraft.


2) This wonderful Christmas concert showcases you in many avatars - an unusual multiple role-playing when compared to what usually happens in the west. Can you explain to me what it is about this project that has motivated you to throw your whole heart and soul - so to speak - into it? 


I am a western classical singer but the roles played in this concert are rarely played by one person in the western classical scene.
I would say the roles were co-producer, conductor (where necessary during the performance) musical director, composer, programming of music, ensemble setting (appointment and selection of musicians) and MC.


What lead me to venture to expand to composition + performance?
In 2017, the president of the Mars Society, Dr. Robert Zubrin, after hearing about my multidisciplinary background, ( physics + computer science + music) suggested I should write an anthem for Mars. I accepted the challenge, but in the Western classical world, generally the roles are very delineated: if one is a conductor, they conduct; if one is a composer, they compose; and a singer just sings. So I thought I'd get a team together. But then my mom, who knew that I had talent in composing music and writing songs, said, "Why don't you just go for it?". That gave rise to my first successful composition “Rise to Mars” which was given status of ‘ Mars Anthem’ by the International Mars Society. This success propelled me to think out of the classical music box, to take the opportunity to express myself by putting down the ideas in my head in the form of musical compositions. 






3) You have ventured into Christmas music with a lot of gusto - expanding the Goan songbook in unusual ways. What does it mean to you to work within our living culture, and was that a factor in your interest. I'm especially touched by what you have done with Umesh - please elaborate and explain how it worked?


Goan Konkani and Portuguese music was a part of my upbringing. My grandfather introduced me to songs like Encosta Tua Cabecinha, Cadiza Za and Tambde Roza and sang Konkani and Portuguese lullabies when I was a baby. His name was Gabriel Pais (1919 - 2004) from Curtorim, the grandson of a Mestri. He would always write poems for us on occasions like birthdays. 


Despite this upbringing I never really sang in Konkani.
My first experience at singing in Konkani was at the Commonwealth Christmas Concert in London in 2020. The organizers suggested I sing something from my culture and I came upon a wonderful carol by Manohar Rai Sardessai and Micael Martins “Mari Matek Ballok Zala” I had limited time to prepare it and although I felt I could do better justice to the language and to blend better my operatic style of singing to the nuances on singing in the Goan style, the listeners were very encouraging in their responses and this got me very excited to delve more into Konkani singing. Carlo Rizzi, a leading Verdi conductor in the operatic world also thought that the Konkani language brought our something refreshing in my voice.


I love when my performances resonate with people, bringing out memories and emotions or just entertaining them thoroughly. I now saw an opportunity to achieve these responses by bringing my training as an opera singer, my creative skills in making melodies and my musical heritage together. In 2025 I unearthed some writings by my grandfather Gabriel Pais in Portuguese and Konkani and adapted them to a musical structure. I was also very fortunate to receive some of Manohar Rai Sardessai’s writings from his son Sunil Sardessai.


My initial compositions to the poems of Manohar Rai Sardesai were met very warmly by his family, particularly my composition for the poem “Ball Jezu Zolmolo” a Christmas poem. I collected more writings by Sardessai and some by my grandfather particularly in Portuguese to create a Christmas concert revolving around these compositions interspersed with favourite Christmas tunes to create “Concerto de Natal” in collaboration with Museum of Goa. I created the ensemble Oscar Castellino & the Timemakers which includes some of Goa’s finest musicians Jason Quadros, Chelsea D'Silva, Nahil Flores and Senon D’Souza. Jason is a versatile pianist and wrote the parts for the ensemble for most of my compositions.


When in Goa during my childhood attending church I was particularly attracted to the way in which the mestri (violinist) would lead the congregation in song. I therefore wanted Senon D'Souza on board who with his violin and Nahil Flores on the ghumot created a distinct Goan feel to the performance.


Note:
During Christmas 2024 I wanted to explore if there were other carols in the Konkani repertoire that I could sing and I came across Judachem ful fulunk tenklem.
Natalm Git. (1995/Book 12)
Utram: Moreno de Souza, S.J. / Nad: Bernardo Cota
Recording and interview (you can use excerpts from that interview) : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fd5nRoXqWMA


I made contact with professor of Mechanical engineering Umesh Manohar Sardessai, son of Manohar Rai Sardessai to help me with understanding his father's poems and to pronounce the Konkani. In the process what I discovered is that he himself is an accomplished lyricist. I had in mind a tune for an upbeat Christmas tune and he was happy to set lyrics to the tune. This gave rise to “Ailim Natalam”. Umesh also gave me insights on the style of delivery of sung Konkani by demonstrating how the lyrics could be sung. Konkani has a sweetness in delivery that I am slowly discovering how to achieve within my operatic voice and Umesh is helping me on this journey.


4) How was the reception from your point of view? How does it compare to your other successes? What's next in this vein? 


This project is ambitious and there is always the chance that I would not do justice to the rich Goan musical tradition. There is always the danger that the artist may overlook aspects of a tradition and slap new ideas that do not resonate with the culture. In this case I have been encouraged by the response and the desire for more such music. So far the music has resonated both with those who enjoy the traditional and those open to furthering the repertoire.


I was overjoyed to see people joining in the singing and dancing to the music - something crucial to the Goan experience. 


This is very different to successes on the operatic stage and the encore of large audiences in the opera houses of Europe. Close to home and closer to heart this endeavour hopes to bring more joy into humble homes and families like the one I grew up in, a ullaby to sing to a baby or a Christmas Carol to a grandmother reminiscing about past Christmases.


The hope is to attract more people to the Goan celebration concert after concert, song after song. Umesh and I have plans for future collaborations in Goa and London. I hope to incorporate more audience participation in the concerts, more singing and dancing, to make it a truly Goan celebration. I am thinking of ways to make it more financially viable for my fellow musicians while making it an unforgettable experience for anyone who comes along. And in turn I hope this music revisits Goan homes across the globe in a post-dinner sing along with friends and family. I will create a webpage with help to learn all new songs.
